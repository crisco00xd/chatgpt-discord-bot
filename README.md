#ðŸ¤– Discord Smart Bot
##A Discord bot that uses the OpenAI API to generate human-like responses to prompts.

#Features
- Generate responses to prompts using the OpenAI API
- Change the temperature of the responses (affects the creativity of the responses)
- Split long responses into chunks to avoid message length limits

###How it works
The bot listens for commands starting with the ! prefix and responds accordingly.

Currently, there are two commands:

- `!smart <prompt>` - generates a response to the given prompt
- `!temp <value>` - changes the temperature of the responses (affects the creativity of the responses)
